# 🚀 EduPlusAI – Automated Student Attendance Monitoring & Analytics System

## 📌 Problem Statement
- **Problem Statement ID**: 25016  
- **Title**: Automated Student Attendance Monitoring and Analytics System for Colleges  
- **Organization**: Government of Punjab  
- **Department**: Department of Higher Education  
- **Theme**: Smart Education  

**Description**:  
Attendance tracking in most colleges is still done manually through roll calls or paper registers. This consumes valuable teaching time, often leads to errors, and makes it difficult to analyze attendance patterns. EduPlusAI solves this problem by automating attendance with QR codes, email OTP login, analytics dashboards, and AI-powered insights.
